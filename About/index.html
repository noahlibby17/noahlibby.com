			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Noah is a senior studying psychology at Bard College. While his research interests are always evolving, Noah is particularly interested in studies of memory, neurorehabilitation after brain injury, the extent to which a person’s psychology is “abnormal”, the prevalence of anxiety, brain-computer interfaces, and the foundations of psychological research in neuroscience. Outside of the lab, Noah is the co-head of the Bard Christian Fellowship and captain of Bard’s Ultimate Frisbee team. He is an avid lover of the woods and enjoys hammocking, living by the ocean, and playing music – Noah aspires to use his love of psychology to write music that voices how people experience mental illness in very real and unique ways.</p>
