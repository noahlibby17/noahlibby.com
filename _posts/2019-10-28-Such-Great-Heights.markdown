Over the past several months, I have written a fair amount of music. The eminent weight of my future sitting on my shoulders has inspired me to think a lot about change. And to think a lot about love. And death. And life. And a whole lot about peace.

I've found most of my peace in music. In my own and in that of others.

All of the songs I write, I write because I need them. I find myself re-listening to my voice memo prophecies and re-reading iPhone Notes-app epistolaries because I need to hear my words back again in order to understand my thoughts. My lyrics are mostly stories that I've needed to tell myself.

I turned in my thesis and graduated college, spent an unforgettable summer with a group of guys that have shown me incomparable love for the longest time, and then I drove a fully-packed minivan towards Minnesota with nothing but an apartment and an interview waiting for me there.

# And it doesn't feel real. Not much is feeling real.

#Having what truly is *free* time for the first time ever has been a liberating and dissonant slap to my soul.
